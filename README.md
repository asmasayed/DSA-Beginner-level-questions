# DSA Questions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to **basic to medium-level Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems**. The questions are sourced from the GeeksforGeeks DSA practice list and are categorized by data structures for easy navigation.
---

## 📂 Repository Structure
The problems are grouped by data structure/topic, and each file contains solutions for multiple questions. Each problem is numbered as per the GeeksforGeeks list for easy reference.
Please note: the prt.c file includes some random questions of all topics which i used to practice and prepare for my viva examinations

### Example Folder Structure:
DSA/ ├── Arrays/ │ ├── array.c/ │ ├── (Question 1: Find minimum or maximum number in array) │ ├── (Question 2:find last duplicate number in sorted array
) ├── Stacks/ │ ├── stacks.c (Question 1: Implement a stack using arrays) ├── Queues/ │ ├── queue.c (Question 1: Circular queue implementation)

## ✍️ Highlights
- **Total Questions Solved:** 50+(and will continue to do more😊) 
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Arrays
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Linked Lists

## 📖 About the Code
1. Each solution is **commented** for clarity.
2. Some files contain **multiple solutions** to similar problems for comparison.
3. The problems are **numbered** and are in increasing order of difficulty

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository
1. Browse the folders based on the data structure you're interested in.
2. Refer to the question in the file to find the original problem on GeeksforGeeks dsa practice questions.
3. Run the code in your local environment to understand and test the solutions.
4. i have refered to this link for questions: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa-tutorial-learn-data-structures-and-algorithms/

## 💡 Future Plans
- Add more advanced-level questions.
- Add problems on non linear data structures
- Add solutions in C++
